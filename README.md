# Synthetic_Biology_Hmwk2

This repository contains data saved after multiple runs of the tool DoubleDutch. DoubleDutch matches genetic factors with genetic levels. 
These matches create a module and that module has a certain expression strength. A string of factors produces a certain output yield. 
The purpose of this assignment is to optimize the yield given a specific model. 
In this assignment we use an R script to create a statistical fit of our yield outputs and create a model that will predict future yields, 
given our current model.
